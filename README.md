Okay quick here are some useful things.

To reach me, I'm always on Discord as user `tgraupmann`. Join my [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/g7vZDkbnKT) so I can help support your project.

Subscribe to my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/TagenigmaLLC) so you can get notifications when I put out developer-focused videos.

In most cases, I'm helping you with Razer Chroma Sensa for RGB lighting and haptics. Check out the [Animation Guide](https://chroma.razer.com/ChromaGuide/) to find all the plugins.
